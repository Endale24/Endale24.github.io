  I am a **Master Degree Candidate** in **infroamtion and communication engineering**, specializing in **wireless communication techonlogies** with a keen interest in using **Deep Learinng Algorithms** such as **RNNs, LTSMs, FNNs**, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiong Lei](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37672697600) at [School of Electronics and Information Engineering](http://en.eie.bjtu.edu.cn/), [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.njtu.edu.cn/). My research is focused on applying explainable **deep learning techniques** to microwave and mmWave band wireless signal propagation time series data to investigate the impairment caused by weather, such as Rain, Temperature, Humidity, cloud, Fogs e.t.c. I use different weather & Climate data sources such as [noaa.gov](https://www.noaa.gov/tools-and-resources/weather-and-climate-resources), [ITUdatabanks](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups/rsg3/Pages/dtbank-dbsg3.aspx),[CHRS](https://chrs.web.uci.edu/) and I also get data from local weather data sources and radiowave propagation measurement data centers such as local telecom vendors, satellite ground stations e.t.c.
